	  <h2><a href="index.html">Allen Zhou</a></h2>
	  <p>My name is Allen Zhou and I'm a Sophomore studying at Tufts
	    University studying computer science and music technology.
	    Besides music and computer science, I have a passion for film
	    and love creating videos, currently through the club Tufts
	    University Television (TUTV). I currently work at Granoff Music
	    Center as part of the Music Events Technical Staff, and I hope
	    to pursue computer science as a software developer for
	    Digital Audio Workstations.
